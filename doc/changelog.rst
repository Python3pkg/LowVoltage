Changelog
=========

????/??/?? v0.7.0
==================

- A few hours after writing "I believe the interface is stable", I had an aha moment and had to change the :ref:`compounds`, making them all functions instead of a mix of classes and badly named functions.

2015/04/26, v0.6.0
==================

- This is the first beta version, so the first to appear in the changelog.
